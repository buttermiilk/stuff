# Preliminary
There are a couple of *tasks* that give you free points. They, technically, aren't *challenges*, and I cover them here. The solution for these are one-offs.

# The Challenges
## osu/welcome

<Chall
  title="Welcome"
  authors={["osu!gang"]}
  category="osu!"
  solvedInTime="yes"
  flag="osu{Rhythm+G4m3_4_L1f3!}"
>
  Welcome to osu!gaming CTF 2025 (Rhythm Game Edition). Please join our Discord for challenge updates and admin support.

  Have fun!
</Chall>

This one only requires us to have a Discord account and join [the contest's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/pJ5VpFKduN). Find the message that announces the start of this contest.

Of course, there is point scaling: a point system that scales with how many people have solved the challenge; we'll have to be quick with this one. I woke up 4 hours after the announcement of the contest. Wonderful, yes?

## osu/lobby

<Chall
  title="Lobby"
  authors={["osu!gang"]}
  category="osu!"
  solvedInTime="yes"
  flag="osu{Welc0me_And_G00d_Luck_Gett1ng_Th3_Secr3t_Prize<3}"

  Join the official CTF lobby osu!gaming CTF 2025 to claim the flag! You are more than welcomed to stay in the lobby for a bit longer and have fun with others.
</Chall>

Simple enough task in hindsight. One has to battle against their own social distance to send anything in a completely out-in-the-wild osu! multiplayer lobby. I sat there for 4 minutes waiting for someone to claim the flag, only after which I did. I'm sorry.

I believe the lobby has closed, but the way we get the flag is just to execute `!flag` in chat, the `#multiplayer` channel. `sahuang` will send a private message to us.

Initially I tried to manually type in the flag, but the way osu! IRC renders `0` and `o` kind of sucked for `1337code`, lol. Just get to the website, open chat and copy from there to avoid any misspells.

## osu/survey

<Chall
  title="Survey"
  authors={["osu!gang"]}
  category="osu!"
  solvedInTime="yes"
  flag="osu{see_you_next_time}"

  free points yay

Do the survey to improve the CTF experience next year, hopefully!

Also the flag is at the end of the survey, before submitting. Remember to hit `Submit` after copying the flag, don't just close the page immediately, lol.

I did that.

Next up, since the very first category of this contest is `crypto`, we'll get into that.
