# Intro
Being a person who's quite illiterate in quick thinking and solving challenges, I didn't ever think of playing in a CTF contest. Granted, I still play CTFs alone for fun because it teaches me ways to do things and satisfies my will to learn about cybersec, but having heard that a CTF is happening *and* it's focused around *the only game I actively play, [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)*, I had to join. I played solo though, being the person who liked doing things alone.

Turns out it was really fun. I'm doing writeups for the sake of learning (and probably to understand concepts while I write as well), I couldn't solve a lot of things in the given timeframe, but later I figured out how to pull these off. I'll show where I failed and what was needed to be done, then my experiences.

# Some notes
For every challenges there'll be a box that says a couple of things:
- The *author* of the challenge, which is self-explanatory,
- The *category/categories of the challenge*, which is the main way to sort after the first subpost,
- The *flag* of that challenge, if I managed to find it again, I don't save them,
- If applicable, the *source code / code* associated with that challenge,
- Whether I found the flag within the given timeframe or not,
- And a short excerpt of the challenge's description.

For the challenges I found really difficult or require extensive explanations and steps, a separated subpost will be dedicated for them. For the one-offs, I'll sort them by category.

Some of these are *really, really technical*, and being a writeup for many things this is going to be *very, very long* as well. Take your time.
