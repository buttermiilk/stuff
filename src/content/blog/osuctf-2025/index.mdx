## Intro
Being a person who's quite illiterate in quick thinking and solving challenges, I didn't ever think of playing in a CTF contest. Granted, I still play CTFs alone for fun because it teaches me ways to do things and satisfies my will to learn about cybersec, but having heard that a CTF is happening *and* it's focused around *the only game I actively play, [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)*, I had to join. I played solo though, being the person who liked doing things alone.

Turns out it was really fun. I'm doing this write-up for the sake of learning (and probably to understand concepts while I write as well), I couldn't solve a lot of things in the given timeframe, but later I figured out how to pull these off. I'll show where I failed and what was needed to be done, then my experiences.

## Some notes
For every challenges there'll be a box that says a couple of things:
- The *author* of the challenge, which is self-explanatory,
- The *category/categories of the challenge*, which is the main way to sort after the first subpost,
- The *flag* of that challenge, if I managed to find it again, I didn't save them,
- Whether I found the flag within the given timeframe or not,
- And a short excerpt of the challenge's description.

Some of these are technical, as expected, and being a writeup for many things, this is also a content dump. This is **an hour long of just reading**. Pick your category from the subposts, and enjoy.
