Small and amazingly unnecessary blog page threw together by generating a fork of the greatest blog template, [astro-erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite), the greatest example of the template [by the template creator themselves](https://enscri.be/), and my own stupidity (lol.)

This was done on a whim without thinking for a CTF write-up contest. You can find the contest [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-21-osugaming-ctf-2025), but that's not the important part. I might update the blog once or a few times a year, it depends on if I consider something worth to be recapped.

Note that the line saying All rights reserved doesn't actually mean anything on this blog and you can just take any content at will, minus the code that makes up the blog. Visit the actual repo for that kind of thing. If you happen to be the template creator, please forgive me for the dirty modifications.

Proper README format later.
